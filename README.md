# üèì Paddle Royale!

*A retro paddle-battle showdown built in PyGame.*

Paddle Royale! is a pixelated homage to arcade classics, reimagined as a personal learning project in Python. Two paddles. One ball. Zero chill. Built from scratch with PyGame, this project explores the fundamentals of 2D game development while keeping things fun and a little cheesy.
